	<h2>Five personal websites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.nathanielkoloc.com/" target="_blank">Nathaniel Koloc</a></li>
		<p>I like this website because it is clean and straightforward. Just a couple of seconds of reading gives me a quite clear picture in my head of what Nathaniel does. I also like the scrolling design, it gives me the information in a good order. The head banner photo is also very inviting, and made me click on the link in the first place, even if it doesn't have a lot to do with what Nathaniel do and offer, I still get a picture of things he enjoy. </p>
	
		<li><a href="http://natecover.com/" target="_blank">Nate Cover</a></li> 
		<p>As in the site above, Nate also have a very inviting and modern looking design/picture on the home page, that make me interested in learning more about him. The website is easily navigated, with the navigation links on the top of the page. The design is calm, unitary and modern, and the content is not to long, but interesting. </p>
	
	
		<li><a href="http://www.allisonstadd.com/" target="_blank">Allison Stadd</a></li>
		<p> An other good personal site in my opinion is Allison Stadds web site. She does also have nice and artistic images that contribute to show what's special about her. I also find it interesting that the home page tells me to scroll down, and I immediately do so, and finds a description of who she is, and then can choose to click on the links on the top and read more. She has done a good job in showcasing the most important things I need to know about her on the first page. </p>
		
		<li><a href="http://deda.me/" target="_blank">Deidre Bain</a></li>
		<p> I like Dedas site since she really show of her talent. Her web site is fun, she give you essential facts about her, but also include information that makes her a real person, like that she likes cheese and sleep, and prefer pizza over apple. This is presented in a way that also show that she is good at graphic and web design, so it is not irrelevant.  </p>
		
		<li><a href="http://www.lottanieminen.com/#graphic-design" target="_blank">Lotta Nieminen</a></li>
		<p> Lottas personal site does a good job in showcasing her style and jobs in illustration and graphic design. The site is divided in three, and you never really leave a webpage, you are just scrolled to the side, where other works are displayed. One can click on the pictures and get an in-depth description of what her job was, scrolling down you will return to the (three divided) main page. This feature makes the feel never ending and soft, in a good way. </p>
	</ul>
